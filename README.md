## âœ… Notes
- All enrichment (coordinates + weather) is done asynchronously using `httpx` and `asyncio`.
- The app keeps cities in memory and saves explicitly via `/save-cities`.
- File path for saving is controlled by the environment variable `CITIES_CSV_PATH`.
- The API follows RESTful standards and returns appropriate status codes.
